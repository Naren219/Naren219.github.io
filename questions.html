        <h3>questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>can we program identity into a machine?</li>
            <li>do we have a notion of how difficult it is to make scientific progress relative to its historical rate? could we prevent fixating this metric on economic progress?</li>
            <li>should we only look towards science when shaping knowledge in our society? what are the implications of rejecting other belief structures (e.g. homeopathy, astrology, etc)?</li>
            <li>does the struggle monks undergo make them any more pure as an individual (in the eyes of the universe)?</li>
