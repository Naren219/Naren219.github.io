    <p>What’s up.</p>
    <p>My interests are in AI, app dev, philosophy, and entrepreneurship. I love reading biographies, sci-fi, history, and more. I’m a student at Research Triangle High.</p>
    <h2>projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>founded Parkware, a platform for users to request parking spaces and have other residential parking space owners near them provide their free driveways to these requestors. After not getting answers to parking issues in my neighborhood, I decided to build something that would fix it.</li>
        <li>wrote a book on how to use Wireshark for wireless networking. amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireshark-Network-Forensics-Essential-Professionals/dp/1484290003">link</a></li>
        <li>started a research project two years ago about continuous gravitational wave detection. project was stopped but this is what i <a href="https://narensgrind.notion.site/Gravitational-Wave-Challenge-Memo-158fe40652044cf892926e6dcea0783d?pvs=4">learned</a>.</li>
        <li>president of philosophy club at my school. we talk about everything that makes you stay up in the night wondering why you exist. here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ov_APYtyrteZUArzCV8xdzEJ3PQkIaG9YgrD0QD1VSI/edit?usp=sharing">doc</a> with our takeaways.</li>
        <li>i’m a lot into digging deeper into the college system, so I wrote this article that got pretty good feedback</li>
        <li>used bokeh and scipy to build a taylor series visualizer. def the coolest thing i learned from ap calculus bc.</li>
        <li>always wondered about the brain and how it learned so i really delved into the state of the art and future developments.</li>
        <li>invisalign is so expensive, right? trying to see beyond the cost and figure out automated ways of doing the <a href="https://narensgrind.notion.site/Ortho-ML-6d43b3856e9d48fa890368ea167ae75a?pvs=4">job</a>.</li>
        <li>thought a lot about the power that recommendation systems have over society. such power in the hands of a very few. opening up the system and making it clear why each decision was made could be better for all of us.</li>
        <li>led a python crash course at my school and it turned out well. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PELn3a87MN3i5KLGm65pDM5PruAHQMq7?usp=drive_link">here's</a> a folder with our slides and code if you want to do something similar.</li>
