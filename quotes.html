        <h3>impactful quotes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>“If you’re ready to realize a much bigger and more powerful future, then you must stop asking yourself, “How can I accomplish this?” That question, although common, leads to mediocre results, frustration, and a life of regrets. A much better question is: “Who can help me achieve this?”” -anonymous</li>
            <li>“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do”</li>
            <li>“A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest form of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal in satisfying his vices. And it all comes from lying — to others and to yourself.” -Dostoyevsky</li>
            <li>"Don't knock on wood, because in the end, the only wood left is on the door to death. "</li>
