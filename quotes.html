        <h3>impactful quotes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” -Steve Jobs</li>
            <li>“A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest form of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal in satisfying his vices. And it all comes from lying — to others and to yourself.” -Dostoyevsky</li>
            <li>"Don't knock on wood, because in the end, the only wood left is on the door to death." -Me</li>
            <li>"Starting a company is like staring into the abyss and eating glass." -Elon Musk</li>
            <li>"If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive."</li>
            <li>"If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever you last spoke with, that’s bad. You will of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with your convictions."</li>
            <li>"I try to be ruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the quickest way possible."</li>
            <li>"The right goal is to allocate your year optimally, not your day."</li>
            <li><b>“The secret to life is enjoying the passage of time."</b></li>
            <li>Avoid a Completionist Mindset at all costs. Else, your life is defined by nothing but your accomplishments.</li>
            <li>"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. To find the best place to start, look within. The whispers of intuition may guide you."</li>
