      <h4>chillosophy is a small club that we host during lunch where we discuss any perplexing questions. my takeaways:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>be aware of the number of delusional desires that you possess</li>
        <li>understand that burnout is a real thing that is inherent in this type of society</li>
        <li>no one really knows how ai will end up. a moratorium would unlikely be able to create any meaningful impact in ai development because one, companies may be able to secretly develop tech and two, ai might be inevitable</li>
        <li>most of your thoughts are formed from a source fueled by capitalism, so don't believe that they're truly yours</li>
        <li>taking pauses in life can help reduce the burnout and stress one may feel. comparing yourself to others would get you nowhere since there would always be someone better than you. us humans always try and find the next best rival and compare ourselves to them, meaning that we're never really satisfied</li>
        <li>capitalism seems like the only true system that can adapt to technological progress, primarily because there isn't any firm that's perfect at anything and this continuous improvement drives companies and consumers</li>
        <li>ai would be capable of discovering things in ways that humans would never think of because, well, they aren't human. yet, it's our challenge to understand and use the ideas that they create -- math proofs, art, science</li>
        <li>Back then, people thought the pursuit of philosophy was the pursuit of some hidden knowledge that would allow them to make sense of the world and their reality. They created “grand narratives,” stories and ideas that try to organize why everything is the way it is. The grand narrative of Christianity is that the resurrection of Jesus will allow him to save humans from their sins. Even non-religious beliefs like logic and its basic principles such as cause and effect try to provide a universal basis for understanding everything (even though it doesn’t seem like it). But there are so many unknowns and incomplete areas in any of these stories, leading to the idea that philosophy isn’t about constructing these new theories about the world but breaking down systems of power and norms that were previously upheld. This is widely considered the ultimate purpose of philosophy.</li>
