    <h3>childhood</h3>
    <p>17...one more year till you become an adult. but what does that really mean. i can be a kid whenever i want, it just depends on my attitude and the way i act. i recently found the value of childhood, the idea of no expectations and just continuous exploration. it seems so free but also mysterious that we end up like this.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>most of the things that i’ve been chasing are just desires that i have just to maintain my reputation for being this way and staying productive always. not to say that my actions are wrong and incorrect. just that they seem to point in the wrong direction.</li>
      <li>the idea of deliberately planning your actions like a homonculus would for your brain seems like the best way to stick to the plan and be productive. however, this doesn’t seem like the best thing. always having a discussion to force yourself (unclear definition) to do something or head in some direction. better to go free and experience everything in first person. this might not even be possible, but who gets to decide that.</li>
      <li>social media and all these distractions are like a person, just demanding more and more time from you. know that your time is valuable and can’t be given up that easily. it’s better to use that time to get lost in yourself instead of others. know that you can let yourself to go into distraction mode and thereby lose yourself.</li>
      <li>forming connections, not just with technical ones but everyone, is very important. it gives a sense of support and perspective shift that is unmatched with anything that you can do.</li>
      <li>the most successful people, elon musk and jeff bezos, have not only done "good" to reach that level. remember that. morality doesn’t just contact what good is and no one can complete follow that. instead, shortcuts were taken and rules were taken to reach that level. whether you want to make those decisions is up to you</li>
      <li>strong and close friends >>> knowing that many people know your name. your time is limited and it’s your decision what you want to spend that time on.</li>
      <li>growth into the position to truly bring progress and control things doesn’t just depend on technical knowledge. understanding how people work and how they should be managed is very important.</li>
      <li>think beyond the meta. it’s important in order to bend expectations and warp the world to fit yourself or allow yourself to enter.</li>
      <li>keep exploring. it’ll keep you young.</li>
    </ul>
