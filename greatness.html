      <h3>greatness</h3>
      <p>
        i was watching a podcast that patrick collison was in and i thought about what it takes to do great things. 
        i’ve realized that i have been unsatisfied overall when i’m modeling my life after someone else, especially 
        if they’re still super young and seem like the “get successful quick.” these people are more approachable/accessible, but to do really big things, 
        i’ve felt that i need to look beyond any person and their achievements. also, there’s the common idea that “it’s fine if i’m not doing my best work since i’m free and can dedicate lots of time toward it.” remember that change and progress only occurs when great work is done consistently over a period of time. you don’t have to be productive the entire day, but setting aside a few hours for important things gives you satisfaction and drive to keep going
